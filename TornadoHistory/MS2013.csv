The tornado moved northeast, snapping and uprooting a number of trees and causing some minor damage to structures as it passed Wiley Dyess Road and T.W. Bass Road. The tornado reached its maximum intensity as it moved along and across Green Creek Road and Carson-Bunker Hill Road. Here two well built brick frame homes were heavily damaged, power poles were snapped, a well built farm building was destroyed. Another outbuilding was also destroyed, extensive tree damage occurred and several other homes and buildings suffered minor to moderate damage. The tornado weakened as it crossed Hunnicut Road snapping a few trees and dissipated before reaching State Highway 42 west of Bassfield. Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 120 mph.","A potent storm system developed across the Inter-Mountain West before tracking east across the Lower Mississippi Valley region February 21st. A rather cold and dry air mass was entrenched across the region through the 20th, with dew points in the teens and twenties. In fact, as atmospheric lift began to approach the area and some light showers moved across portions of the Delta, light sleet occurred. There was not enough sleet to cause travel problems, but it showed how cold the atmosphere was prior to the incoming low pressure system. ||By the morning of the 21st, the warm front was still located along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Dew points were still in the upper 30s as of late morning across Central Mississippi. Some showers and isolated thunderstorms moved through the area producing small hail. The warm front slowly moved north and by mid to late afternoon, dew points had finally increased to the mid and upper 50s across the I-20 corridor and were in the mid 60s further south. This helped to fuel additional showers and thunderstorms as the main upper level storm system tracked northeast. As the moisture increased across the region, the combination of strong wind shear and an unstable air mass south of the warm front became more conducive to supercell and tornado development. Strong storms were moving through the southwestern portions of the region later that afternoon. ||Around 5 pm storms began to exhibit rotation on radar and a tornado developed in Concordia Parish just south of Clayton. This tornado produced some damage to some homes and trailers in the area. As the low pressure gradually tracked northeast and the warm front lifted further north, the environment became more favorable for tornadoes in southern Mississippi. One storm had continuous rotation as it moved from north-central Louisiana into south-central Mississippi. This storm crossed southeast Lawrence to northwest Marion counties around 10 pm and continued to track northeast. Rotation began to intensify and a strong tornado developed around 10:30 pm a few miles southwest of Bassfield. This tornado caused minor to moderate damage to some homes and buildings, snapped some power poles and caused extensive tree damage. Another weak tornado developed around 11 pm a few miles southwest of Collins snapping some trees and causing some damage to a mobile home and a chicken house.

Maximum sustained winds were 95 mph.","Much needed heavy rain fell across the ArkLaMiss beginning on the 20th and continuing into the 21st ahead of an approaching cold front. High moisture content was present ahead of this front as atmospheric profiles showed moisture content nearing two standard deviations above normal for late September. This set the stage for several inches of rain to fall over a region that was seeing below normal monthly rainfall, burn bans and high fire danger. A steady rain fell during the overnight hours of the 20th into the 21st, bringing a widespread one to three inches of rain to the ArkLaMiss. The heaviest rain fell along the Natchez Trace Parkway corridor, where three to five inches of rain fell. ||In addition to the rains, five tornadoes occurred during the evening and overnight hours. These tornadoes were small and brief, and were embedded in the rain shield as it sweeped across the region. The first three tornadoes that occurred were in smaller discrete cells, while the last two occurred in a strong rain band. Much of the damage was minor, and no fatalities or injuries occurred.",28
